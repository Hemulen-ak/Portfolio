Place your PDF files in this folder. To add or update resources, edit the resources.json file in this folder. Each entry should look like:

{
  "title": "Descriptive Title",
  "description": "Short description of the PDF resource",
  "file": "filename.pdf"
}

No code changes neededâ€”just update the JSON and add/remove PDF files here.
